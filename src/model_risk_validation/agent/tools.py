"""Tool functions an agent runtime calls: thin, side-effect-honest wrappers on the services.

Design rules, in the order they matter:

* **No business logic here.** The domain service decides HOW; the model only decides WHICH tool
  to call. A rule that lives in a tool wrapper is a rule the CLI and the API do not have.
* **Rule R8 applies on this path too.** An escalated result is ROUTED from inside the tool, in
  the same call that produced it. An agent surface that only returned the flag would be a third
  place an escalation can quietly stop, after the API and the CLI.
* **Import-safe without a runtime.** ``google.adk`` is imported lazily inside
  :func:`build_function_tools`, so these callables are importable, testable and runnable with
  no ADK and no cloud SDK installed.
* **Typed and documented.** A runtime derives each tool's name, description and JSON parameter
  schema from the signature and the docstring, so both are part of the contract.
